#How it works

Once you download the repository, go to terminal(linux) and locate directory in terminal
then run this command:

`source .env/bin/activate`

You should see this change

Example:

FROM `yourpc:~/Descargas/MiniQuiz-master$` TO `(.env) yourpc:~/Descargas/MiniQuiz-master$`

Now run next command:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

Go to localhost and prove how the page works.
